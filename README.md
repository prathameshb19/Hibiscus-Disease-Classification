# Hibiscus-Leaf-Disease-Classification
Pest-infested plants and crops have an effect on the nation's agricultural output. Usually, farmers or experts maintain a constant eye on the plants to spot and recognise diseases. This process is typically expensive, time-consuming, and inaccurate. Looking for different signs or patches on the affected plant's leaves might help identify plant diseases. The objective of this project is to develop a disease classification model that is backed by classification of leaf images. We are using Convolution neural network (CNN) image processing to identify plant diseases!

A convolutional neural network (CNN or convnet) is a subset of machine learning. It is one of the many different kinds of artificial neural networks that are applied to numerous applications and data types. Specifically used for image recognition and other tasks involving the processing of pixel data, CNNs are a type of network design for deep learning algorithms

The project has the potential to be used by a variety of people, including farmers, nursery operators, and anyone who checks for contaminated leaves.
The user can simply upload photographs of the suspected leaves to the website, which will then classify the disease based on the input images. With the use of a CNN model that was trained on a large amount of photographs of hibiscus plants leafs, this project intends to create a website that can correctly identify potato diseases. React Native will be used to build the website. Utilising FastAPI, the backend server will be created.
